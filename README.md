Learning about github with hello world
I am going to be 55 next month. It doesn't seem like I am that old most of the time and other times when my arthritis is acting up and my back is hurting from my discs being gone, it seems like I am at least 55 or maybe older. Still, life is great and I am enjoying myself and happy.
